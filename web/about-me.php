                <p>Ever since I was in middle school I've wanted to take a ceramics class. So, since this is my last
        semester I decided to take the class. I love working with my hands and see something come to life.

        <p>Small Engines is another class I'm taking this semester. It's surprising how simple an engine is.
        This is another class that I'm really enjoying. I love seeing what the world is made of.</p>
